## [Demo](http://alanvarghese.me/projects/motivational-quotes/app.html)   |   [Source](https://github.com/waterrmalann/motivational-quotes/blob/main/js/main.js)

A simple web-app that displays a motivational quote (with its author) everytime you reload the page. You can also press the Enter key to generate a new quote. The quotes used are from this lovely [repository of motivational quotes](https://github.com/JamesFT/Database-Quotes-JSON) and the background images are fetched from [Unsplash](https://source.unsplash.com/). This project was written in HTML, CSS, and pure vanilla JavaScript with no external dependencies.

### Setup

A live version is hosted on my personal portfolio at this [link](http://alanvarghese.me/projects/motivational-quotes/app.html). If you wish to modify it, you can clone the repo and do whatever you want with it. You can also add or remove the quotes by editing the `quotes.json` file in the root directory.

### Contribution

Contributions are always accepted. Feel free to open a pull request to fix any issues or to make improvements you think that should be made. Any contribution will be accepted as long as it doesn't stray too much from the objective of the app. If you're in doubt about whether the PR would be accepted or not, you can always open an issue to get my opinion on it.
